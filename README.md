# IMDb Top 250 Movies Scraper

In this project, we intend to extract information from the top 250 movies on the IMDb website based on their titles. You can view the titles of these movies at this [link](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250). This project consists of three different phases, which are as follows:

1. **Data Extraction from IMDb Website**
   
   In this phase, we will extract the necessary information from the IMDb website.

2. **Database Creation and Data Storage using Python Interface**

   We will create a database and store the extracted information in it using a Python interface.

3. **Dashboard Creation for Displaying Required Analyses with Streamlit**

   The final phase involves creating a dashboard to display the required analyses using Streamlit.

Feel free to explore each phase and contribute to the project!
